<h1>About Odor-Informatics Portal</h1>

<h2>What is 11ty?</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/48401/1628645210-11ty-blog-tutorial.png" alt="11ty Image"></p>
<p>11ty, short for Eleventy, is a simple yet powerful static site generator (SSG) built with JavaScript. Unlike traditional CMS-based platforms, 11ty focuses on simplicity and flexibility, allowing developers to create websites from various data formats like Markdown, YAML, JSON, or JavaScript functions.</p>
<h2>How Does 11ty Function?</h2>
<p>11ty operates by transforming templates and data files into static HTML pages. It works by scanning the project directory for input files, processing them using customizable templates, and outputting static HTML files. This approach enables rapid development, as content is pre-rendered during the build process, resulting in faster loading times and better performance.</p>
<h2>Advantages of 11ty Over React:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: 11ty offers a simpler development experience compared to React, especially for static websites. Its minimalistic approach reduces complexity and overhead, making it easier to maintain and deploy projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Since 11ty generates static HTML files, websites built with it tend to have faster loading times and better performance compared to React applications, which require client-side rendering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: 11ty doesn't impose any specific structure or conventions, allowing developers to organize their projects according to their preferences. This flexibility is particularly advantageous for smaller projects or websites with straightforward requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ease of Deployment</strong>: Deploying 11ty sites is straightforward due to their static nature. They can be easily hosted on various platforms, including static site hosts like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or traditional web servers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations of 11ty:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Dynamic Functionality</strong>: While 11ty excels at generating static content, it may not be suitable for dynamic web applications that require real-time updates or complex user interactions. In such cases, integrating dynamic features may require additional effort and may not be as seamless as with frameworks like React.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Performance Stats</h2>
<p><img src="https://the-refinery.io/uploads/hero-images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/google-lighthouse-04.jpg" alt="Performance Image"></p>
<p>In terms of speed and efficiency, it's worth noting that the same application built in React took around <strong>16-20 seconds</strong> to load and render all 12,000 rows of data. In contrast, 11ty accomplishes the same task in just <strong>2-3 seconds</strong>, making it approximately <strong>6 to 10 times faster</strong> than React, showcasing its superior performance and speed.</p>
